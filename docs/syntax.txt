fn () {} declares a new function

let creates a new variable, by default variables are immutable
which means that after a value is given, the variable won't change
in order to make a variable mutable, add mut before the declaration
immutable variable:
let apples = 5;
mutable variable:
let mut guess = String::new();

using the example above, :: indicates that new is a function associated
to the String type

match {expression} {
    {option1} => {result1},
    option2...
}

loop {}
